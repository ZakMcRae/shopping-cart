## Description
This app is a fake e-commerce site with a functional shopping cart. Users can view the products page with a small selection of tools. Tools can be added to cart. In the cart, tools can be removed and quantities can be changed. The order total is displayed in real time in the cart. The shopping cart icon in the nav bar also tracks the quantity of the items in the cart.
